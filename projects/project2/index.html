  <h1>Project 2: Persuasive or Deceptive Visualization?</h1>
  
  <section>
    <h2>Proposition</h2>
    <p><strong>Abortion access in the United States significantly declined between 2017 and 2020.</strong></p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>FOR the Proposition</h2>
    <img src="abortion-rates-plummet.png" alt="Abortion Rates Plummet visualization">
    <p><em>"Abortion Rates Plummet: Dramatic Declines Across Multiple States (2017-2020)"</em></p>
    
    <h3>Design Decisions and Rationale:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Selective State Filtering (Score: -1.5):</strong> I deliberately showed only the 12 states with the largest rate declines, completely excluding the ~15 states where rates actually increased. This creates a one-sided narrative suggesting universal decline. I framed this selection as "most affected states" to make the cherry-picking sound methodologically justified rather than manipulative. This was highly effective because viewers don't question what's missing.</li>
      
      <li><strong>Vertical Bar Orientation with Downward Direction (Score: -0.5):</strong> I used vertical bars extending downward into negative territory to psychologically emphasize "falling" or "collapse." The downward visual direction triggers emotional responses about loss and decline more than horizontal bars would. While bar charts are standard, the vertical orientation specifically amplifies the sense of crisis.</li>
      
      <li><strong>Red Color Palette (Score: -1):</strong> I chose red (#e57373) and dark red borders (#c62828) because red is psychologically associated with danger, alarm, and crisis. This emotionally primes viewers to see the data as catastrophic before reading any numbers. Neutral colors like gray or blue would present identical data without the emotional manipulation.</li>
      
      <li><strong>Emotionally Charged Title and Language (Score: -1.5):</strong> The title uses loaded words like "plummet" and "dramatic" to frame statistical changes as a crisis. "Plummet" specifically suggests uncontrolled falling and creates urgency. A more earnest title would be "Changes in Abortion Rates by State, 2017-2020" without emotional framing.</li>
      
      <li><strong>Value Labels Emphasizing Magnitude (Score: 0):</strong> I added percentage labels directly on each bar in black text for clarity. This is technically earnest (improves readability), but I positioned them prominently to emphasize how large the negative numbers are, especially Missouri's -98%. I considered removing labels for smaller declines but kept all of them to create visual consistency.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>AGAINST the Proposition</h2>
    <img src="abortion-access-expanded.png" alt="Abortion Access Expanded visualization">
    <p><em>"Abortion Access Expanded: Rates Increased Significantly Across Multiple States (2017-2020)"</em></p>
    
    <h3>Design Decisions and Rationale:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Selective State Filtering (Score: -1.5):</strong> I showed only the 12 states with the largest rate increases, completely ignoring states with declines. This creates a mirror-opposite narrative suggesting access is expanding nationally. By cherry-picking only positive examples, I persuade viewers that abortion access improved everywhere, when the full dataset shows mixed trends across states.</li>
      
      <li><strong>Positive Blue Color Palette (Score: -1):</strong> I deliberately chose calming blue colors (#64b5f6, #1976d2) because blue is associated with trust, stability, and progress. This contrasts sharply with the alarming reds in the FOR visualization. The same percentage changes feel like "good news" simply because of color choice, demonstrating how color alone manipulates emotional interpretation.</li>
      
      <li><strong>Plus Signs in Value Labels (Score: -0.5):</strong> I added "+" symbols before each percentage ("+100%", "+35%") to explicitly emphasize growth and positive change. While technically accurate notation, the plus signs draw extra visual attention to increases and make the gains feel more significant and celebratory than if I'd just written the numbers.</li>
      
      <li><strong>Optimistic Title Framing (Score: -1.5):</strong> The title uses positive language like "expanded" and "increased significantly" to frame the data as progress. The phrase "across multiple states" implies widespread improvement when I'm actually only showing carefully selected examples. An earnest title would acknowledge that these are cherry-picked states with increases, not representative of national trends.</li>
      
      <li><strong>Clean, Professional Visual Design (Score: +1.5):</strong> I used clear axis labels, readable Helvetica fonts, appropriate bar widths, and subtle gridlines for easy reading. Percentage values are labeled in high-contrast black text on each bar. This earnest design choice prioritizes transparency and data accuracy, allowing viewers to understand exact values without confusion or visual tricks.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Final Reflection</h2>
    
    <p>This project was both straightforward and deeply uncomfortable. The easy part was the technical execution—finding compelling data points, creating clean visualizations, and identifying states that supported each narrative. The difficult part was confronting how naturally deception came to me once I committed to a proposition. I kept catching myself thinking "but Missouri really DID decline 98%!" to justify my cherry-picking, which made me realize that the most dangerous deception uses real numbers to tell incomplete stories. The hardest moment came when I spent 30 minutes deciding whether to show 10, 12, or 15 states for maximum visual impact—that calculation felt uncomfortably similar to p-hacking in research.</p>
    
    <p>What surprised me most was how the same design choice could feel completely different depending on which narrative I was supporting. When I made the FOR visualization with red colors and crisis language, it felt urgent and true to me because I personally believe abortion access has declined overall. But when I made the AGAINST visualization with blue and optimistic framing, it felt like I was sugarcoating reality—even though I was using the exact same techniques (selective filtering, emotional color choices, loaded language). This revealed my own bias: I found it easier to be deceptive in service of a claim I believe is false. The color psychology especially struck me—changing from red to blue altered the entire emotional tone without changing a single data point, which shows how much visualization is about storytelling rather than neutral presentation.</p>
    
    <p>I now define "ethical analysis and visualization" as designing with intellectual honesty about what you're showing and what you're omitting. Ethical visualization should acknowledge gaps in the data, avoid emotional manipulation that adds no informational value, and make methodological choices transparent (like stating "showing only states with declines" rather than implying these represent all states). However, I don't think "ethical" means "neutral"—all visualization has a point of view because you must choose what to show and how to show it. The question is whether you're honest about that point of view or trying to hide it. I'd draw the line between "acceptable persuasion" and "misleading" at disclosure: acceptable persuasion highlights real patterns and uses design to make them clear (like using position and size to show magnitude), while misleading choices actively hide contradictory evidence or use psychological tricks to manufacture conclusions that misrepresent the complete dataset. My visualizations crossed into misleading territory through cherry-picking combined with framing that implied completeness. The ethics also depend on context—these same visualizations would be acceptable in an academic exercise about rhetoric (like this assignment) but unethical if deployed in a political campaign without disclaimers.</p>
