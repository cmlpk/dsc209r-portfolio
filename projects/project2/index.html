  <h1>Project 2: Persuasive or Deceptive Visualization?</h1>
  
  <section>
    <h2>Proposition</h2>
    <p><strong>Abortion access in the United States significantly declined between 2017 and 2020.</strong></p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>FOR the Proposition</h2>
    <img src="abortion-rates-plummet.png" alt="Abortion Rates Plummet visualization">
    <p><em>"Abortion Rates Plummet: Dramatic Declines Across Multiple States (2017-2020)"</em></p>
    
    <h3>Design Decisions and Rationale:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Selective State Filtering (Score: -1.5):</strong> I deliberately showed only the 12 states with the largest rate declines, completely excluding the ~15 states where rates actually increased. This creates a one-sided narrative suggesting universal decline. I framed this selection as "most affected states" to make the cherry-picking sound methodologically justified rather than manipulative.</li>
      
      <li><strong>Vertical Bar Orientation with Downward Direction (Score: -0.5):</strong> I used vertical bars extending downward into negative territory to psychologically emphasize "falling" or "collapse." The downward visual direction triggers emotional responses about loss and decline more than horizontal bars would.</li>
      
      <li><strong>Red Color Palette (Score: -1):</strong> I chose red (#e57373) and dark red borders (#c62828) because red is psychologically associated with danger, alarm, and crisis. This emotionally primes viewers to see the data as catastrophic before reading any numbers.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

    <h2>AGAINST the Proposition</h2>
    <img src="abortion-access-expanded.png" alt="Abortion Access Expanded visualization">
    <p><em>"Abortion Access Expanded: Rates Increased Significantly Across Multiple States (2017-2020)"</em></p>
    
    <h3>Design Decisions and Rationale:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Selective State Filtering (Score: -1.5):</strong> I showed only the 12 states with the largest rate increases, completely ignoring states with declines. This creates a mirror-opposite narrative suggesting access is expanding nationally. By cherry-picking only positive examples, I persuade viewers that abortion access improved everywhere, when the full dataset shows mixed trends across states.</li>
      
      <li><strong>Positive Blue Color Palette (Score: -1):</strong> I deliberately chose calming blue colors (#64b5f6, #1976d2) because blue is associated with trust, stability, and progress. This contrasts sharply with the alarming reds in the FOR visualization. The same percentage changes feel like "good news" simply because of color choice, demonstrating how color alone manipulates emotional interpretation.</li>
      
      <li><strong>Plus Signs in Value Labels (Score: -0.5):</strong> I added "+" symbols before each percentage ("+100%", "+35%") to explicitly emphasize growth and positive change. While technically accurate notation, the plus signs draw extra visual attention to increases and make the gains feel more significant and celebratory than if I'd just written the numbers.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

    <h2>Final Reflection</h2>
    
    <p>This project was both insightful and challenging. The technical work was simple, but it was surprising how easily persuasive choices could become misleading. I saw how omitting certain states or changing colors could shape interpretation even when the data stayed accurate. Small design details like color and labeling had a bigger impact than I expected.</p>
    
    <p>The same techniques felt different depending on the message. The red “decline” chart seemed urgent, while the blue “expansion” chart felt reassuring, showing how framing and bias influence perception.</p>
    
    <p>I now see ethical visualization as presenting data honestly while acknowledging limitations. Persuasion is acceptable when it clarifies patterns, but it becomes misleading when it hides context or uses emotion to steer conclusions. Ethical design requires awareness of how every choice affects what viewers believe.</p>
