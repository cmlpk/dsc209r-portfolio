  <h1>Project 2: Persuasive or Deceptive Visualization?</h1>
  
  <section>
    <h2>Proposition</h2>
    <p><strong>Abortion access in the United States significantly declined between 2017 and 2020.</strong></p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>FOR the Proposition</h2>
    <img src="abortion-rates-plummet.png" alt="Abortion Rates Plummet visualization">
    <p><em>"Abortion Rates Plummet: Dramatic Declines Across Multiple States (2017-2020)"</em></p>
    
    <h3>Design Decisions and Rationale:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Selective State Filtering (Score: -1.5):</strong> I deliberately showed only the 12 states with the largest rate declines, completely excluding the ~15 states where rates actually increased. This creates a one-sided narrative suggesting universal decline. I framed this selection as "most affected states" to make the cherry-picking sound methodologically justified rather than manipulative.</li>
      
      <li><strong>Vertical Bar Orientation with Downward Direction (Score: -0.5):</strong> I used vertical bars extending downward into negative territory to psychologically emphasize "falling" or "collapse." The downward visual direction triggers emotional responses about loss and decline more than horizontal bars would.</li>
      
      <li><strong>Red Color Palette (Score: -1):</strong> I chose red (#e57373) and dark red borders (#c62828) because red is psychologically associated with danger, alarm, and crisis. This emotionally primes viewers to see the data as catastrophic before reading any numbers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>AGAINST the Proposition</h2>
    <img src="abortion-access-expanded.png" alt="Abortion Access Expanded visualization">
    <p><em>"Abortion Access Expanded: Rates Increased Significantly Across Multiple States (2017-2020)"</em></p>
    
    <h3>Design Decisions and Rationale:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Selective State Filtering (Score: -1.5):</strong> I showed only the 12 states with the largest rate increases, completely ignoring states with declines. This creates a mirror-opposite narrative suggesting access is expanding nationally. By cherry-picking only positive examples, I persuade viewers that abortion access improved everywhere, when the full dataset shows mixed trends across states.</li>
      
      <li><strong>Positive Blue Color Palette (Score: -1):</strong> I deliberately chose calming blue colors (#64b5f6, #1976d2) because blue is associated with trust, stability, and progress. This contrasts sharply with the alarming reds in the FOR visualization. The same percentage changes feel like "good news" simply because of color choice, demonstrating how color alone manipulates emotional interpretation.</li>
      
      <li><strong>Plus Signs in Value Labels (Score: -0.5):</strong> I added "+" symbols before each percentage ("+100%", "+35%") to explicitly emphasize growth and positive change. While technically accurate notation, the plus signs draw extra visual attention to increases and make the gains feel more significant and celebratory than if I'd just written the numbers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Final Reflection</h2>
    
    <p>This project presented both straightforward and challenging aspects. The technical execution—identifying compelling data points, creating clean visualizations, and selecting states that supported each narrative—proved relatively manageable. The more difficult challenge involved confronting how readily deceptive techniques emerged once committed to a particular proposition. Throughout the process, I found myself rationalizing selective data presentation by noting the factual accuracy of individual data points, such as Missouri's 98% decline. This experience illuminated how the most insidious forms of deception leverage truthful numbers to construct incomplete narratives. The deliberation over whether to display 10, 12, or 15 states for optimal visual impact was particularly uncomfortable, as this calculation resembled the problematic practice of p-hacking in research methodology.</p>
    
    <p>The most striking discovery was how identical design choices evoked different responses depending on the narrative being constructed. The FOR visualization, employing red colors and crisis-oriented language, felt authentic and urgent, likely because I personally believe abortion access has declined nationally. Conversely, the AGAINST visualization, utilizing blue tones and optimistic framing, felt like an inadequate representation of reality—despite employing identical techniques of selective filtering, emotional color psychology, and loaded language. This asymmetry revealed a significant personal bias: I found deceptive practices more ethically troubling when deployed in service of claims I consider false. The color psychology proved particularly influential—the transition from red to blue fundamentally altered the emotional interpretation without modifying any underlying data, demonstrating that visualization functions primarily as narrative construction rather than neutral information presentation.</p>
    
    <p>Through this exercise, I have come to define ethical analysis and visualization as the practice of designing with intellectual honesty regarding both what is presented and what is omitted. Ethical visualization should acknowledge data limitations, avoid emotional manipulation that provides no informational value, and maintain transparency in methodological choices—such as explicitly noting when only states with declines are shown rather than implying comprehensive representation. However, I do not equate "ethical" with "neutral," as all visualization inherently embodies a point of view through necessary choices about what to display and how to represent it. The crucial question is whether one maintains honesty about that perspective or attempts to obscure it. I would distinguish "acceptable persuasion" from "misleading" practices through the principle of disclosure: acceptable persuasion highlights genuine patterns in data and employs design elements to enhance clarity (such as using position and size to convey magnitude), whereas misleading choices actively conceal contradictory evidence or deploy psychological techniques to generate conclusions that misrepresent the complete dataset. My visualizations crossed into misleading territory through the combination of cherry-picking data and framing that implied comprehensiveness. Ultimately, the ethical implications are context-dependent—these visualizations are appropriate within an academic exercise examining rhetoric, but would be ethically problematic if deployed in a political campaign without explicit disclaimers about their selective nature.</p>
