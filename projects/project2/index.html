  <h1>Project 2: Persuasive or Deceptive Visualization?</h1>
  
  <section>
    <h2>Proposition</h2>
    <p><strong>Abortion access in the United States significantly declined between 2017 and 2020.</strong></p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>FOR the Proposition</h2>
    <img src="abortion-rates-plummet.png" alt="Abortion Rates Plummet visualization">
    <p><em>"Abortion Rates Plummet: Dramatic Declines Across Multiple States (2017-2020)"</em></p>
    
    <h3>Design Decisions and Rationale:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Selective State Filtering (Score: -1.5):</strong> I deliberately showed only the 12 states with the largest rate declines, completely excluding the ~15 states where rates actually increased. This creates a one-sided narrative suggesting universal decline. I framed this selection as "most affected states" to make the cherry-picking sound methodologically justified rather than manipulative.</li>
      
      <li><strong>Vertical Bar Orientation with Downward Direction (Score: -0.5):</strong> I used vertical bars extending downward into negative territory to psychologically emphasize "falling" or "collapse." The downward visual direction triggers emotional responses about loss and decline more than horizontal bars would.</li>
      
      <li><strong>Red Color Palette (Score: -1):</strong> I chose red (#e57373) and dark red borders (#c62828) because red is psychologically associated with danger, alarm, and crisis. This emotionally primes viewers to see the data as catastrophic before reading any numbers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>AGAINST the Proposition</h2>
    <img src="abortion-access-expanded.png" alt="Abortion Access Expanded visualization">
    <p><em>"Abortion Access Expanded: Rates Increased Significantly Across Multiple States (2017-2020)"</em></p>
    
    <h3>Design Decisions and Rationale:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Selective State Filtering (Score: -1.5):</strong> I showed only the 12 states with the largest rate increases, completely ignoring states with declines. This creates a mirror-opposite narrative suggesting access is expanding nationally. By cherry-picking only positive examples, I persuade viewers that abortion access improved everywhere, when the full dataset shows mixed trends across states.</li>
      
      <li><strong>Positive Blue Color Palette (Score: -1):</strong> I deliberately chose calming blue colors (#64b5f6, #1976d2) because blue is associated with trust, stability, and progress. This contrasts sharply with the alarming reds in the FOR visualization. The same percentage changes feel like "good news" simply because of color choice, demonstrating how color alone manipulates emotional interpretation.</li>
      
      <li><strong>Plus Signs in Value Labels (Score: -0.5):</strong> I added "+" symbols before each percentage ("+100%", "+35%") to explicitly emphasize growth and positive change. While technically accurate notation, the plus signs draw extra visual attention to increases and make the gains feel more significant and celebratory than if I'd just written the numbers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Final Reflection</h2>
    
    <p>This project presented both straightforward and challenging aspects. The technical execution proved manageable: identifying data points, creating visualizations, and selecting supporting states. The difficulty emerged in confronting how readily deceptive techniques appeared once committed to a proposition. I found myself justifying selective presentation by noting factual accuracy of individual points, such as Missouri's 98% decline. This revealed how insidious deception leverages truthful numbers to construct incomplete narratives. Deliberating whether to display 10, 12, or 15 states for optimal impact felt uncomfortably similar to p-hacking in research.</p>
    
    <p>The most striking discovery was how identical design choices evoked different responses depending on the narrative. The FOR visualization with red colors felt authentic and urgent, likely reflecting my belief that access has declined nationally. The AGAINST visualization with blue tones felt inadequate, despite employing identical techniques of selective filtering and emotional framing. This revealed significant bias: I found deceptive practices more troubling when supporting claims I consider false. Color psychology proved particularly influential. Changing from red to blue altered emotional interpretation without modifying underlying data, demonstrating that visualization functions as narrative construction rather than neutral presentation.</p>
    
    <p>I now define ethical visualization as designing with intellectual honesty about what is presented and omitted. Ethical visualization acknowledges data limitations, avoids manipulative emotional framing, and maintains methodological transparency. However, I do not equate ethical with neutral, as all visualization embodies a point of view through necessary design choices. I distinguish acceptable persuasion from misleading practices through disclosure. Acceptable persuasion highlights genuine patterns using design to enhance clarity. Misleading choices conceal contradictory evidence or deploy psychological techniques to misrepresent the complete dataset. My visualizations crossed into misleading territory through cherry-picking combined with framing that implied comprehensiveness. The ethics depend on context: these visualizations are appropriate for academic exercises examining rhetoric, but would be problematic in political campaigns without explicit disclaimers.</p>
